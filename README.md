### Crop Care
One of the most significant components of this app is the CropCare section, which is designed to assist farmers throughout the entire farming lifecycle. It will cover pre-harvesting, harvesting, and post-harvesting phases. Within this section, farmers will receive valuable recommendations related to crop types and suitable fertilizers using a machine learning model trained using Random Forest Algorithm. Furthermore, the app will utilize advanced technology, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), to detect diseases and pests affecting crops based on image data. Additionally, it will provide farmers with yield predictions, helping them make informed decisions to optimize their crop yields and overall farming success.
